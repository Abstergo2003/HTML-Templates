# HTML Templates

### This repository contains various HTML templates (for example CV). You can freely download and edit them, without atrributing any work to me.

### In each folder is polish and english version of template, there is html file containing fields description and one filled with random data (every similarities to real persons is random and not planned)

#### Becarefull since you need just a little of brain power to adapt every template to your needs.
#### Remember, if you insert any picture in html you need to send it as well, or just link it from some site. You dont need though to send css file since I incorporated it in html, its just there for easier edition.

# I hope it will come in handy for you some day.
